						<b>#Seetša!</b> It is that time again whereby I am organizing an annual lengthy memorial
						around Europe especially in Berlin to share with diverse societies relating to the
						<b>Untold Truth Of The Afrakan Colonial Soldiers</b> of world wars.
						This year, 2024 marks our fifth year of hosting lengthy memorials to honour our
						forethathers. It was a long silent walk, which unfolding into different phases over the
						past four years and with clear answers of what happened during the erasure of
						sinless Afrakan soldiers/men who were displayed as cannon fodders and
						discriminated due to the colour of their pigmentation.
						Their great deeds of ending the wars to liberate western countries or Europe from
						their own fascists was buried and whitewashed. This is the golden era of discovering
						the black history that was buried in time and covered with a white silk linen through
						white supremacy systems.

						<br><br>
						Supporting <b>Walk Of Death - DemoExhibit28101943</b> will assist to antidote the errors
						of yesterday that caused by colonialism and horrors of wars that were powered by
						white supremacy. Let&#39;s continue to paint the sky with their names (Afrakan Colonial
						Soldiers of World War I &amp; II).

						<br><br>
						We request donations to ensure that the event on <b>28th October 2024 at
							Siegessäule/Victory Column/Großer Stern, 10557 Berlin</b> should be successful by
						showering it with financial blessings. We will keep walking until the lengthy
						remembrances are acknowledged by all the relevant global governance and takes
						responsibility of working together to rectify the erasure of our Afrakan Colonial
						Soldiers of both world wars. We demand reparations for the atrocities, crimes and
						horrors they have caused for decades to Afrakan families. Colonialism and World
						Wars torned apart millions of Afrakan nations. We will be thrilled by witnessing our
						Afrakan diaspora who will be attending the event and holding white small flags as a
						symbol of repatriating the souls of our Afrakan warriors of world wars. <b>#Seetša!</b>

							Walk Of Death – Untold Truth Of The Afrakan Colonial Soldiers (28 October 1943)
						</h3>
						<p>
							Blessings of ancestors are greater than those of living human
							beings.
						</p>
						<p>
							This year, it marks <span id="years_since_war"> 77 </span> years of the wars end,we are
							blessed
							with
							<b>the
								discovery of the untold truth of the Afrakan Colonial Soldiers.</b>
							The discovery of our black world that was buried in time and
							currently brought to you by new revolutionary voices from afar
							that are calling globally.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Walk of death</b> is one of the <b>horrors of world wars and crimes of
								colonialism</b> that deserves a lengthy or lasting memorial.
							It happened <span id="years_since"> 79 </span> years ago, when more than 33,000 South
							Afrakan
							soldiers and other soldiers from Afrakan states were captured as
							Prisoner of War in Tobruk, Libya.
						</p>
						<p>
							My grandfather: BMT4379/N4379 -Benjamin Satiba Makgate was amongst
							those great men and he noted the happenings of their captivity
							in his diary.
						</p>
						<p>
							They were living in <b>FRONSTALAGS number</b> 133, 153, 171 and 221 in
							Germany, France and Italy.
						</p>
						<p>
							At this moment, the Europeans esp. the German people are
							frightened by the word <b>FRONSTALAGS</b>, which reminds them of their crimes.
							It turns out that world history that has been written by
							white historians is blind and mentally unsound when it comes
							to Afrakan heroes, the real heroes and veterans of wars. Afrakan
							soldiers were crucified during the walk of death and some
							survived the ordeal in Europe and the white world has never
							televised them. Remember that our Afrakan History was
							written by white historians on a white page with a white ink
							therefore narrating it was difficult for centuries.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bear in mind that it started during the devastating 1
							st World War, Afrakan Colonial Soldiers contributed to end the war that created
							miseries to the continent. Afraka is a bee that’s been tormented
							for its own honey.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our great-grandfathers, grandfathers,fathers and uncles were
							conscripted to join the forces and displayed as canon fodders in
							both wars. More than two (2) million Afrakan soldiers died and they didn’t
							have without proper burials and there were no compensations
							for their families.
						</p>
						<p>
							Black families were torn apart by European and western
							militarism, alliances, imperialism and nationalism where as
							Afraka was not supposed to be part of the wars as a victim
							of its own resources and wealth.
						</p>
						<p>
							We inherited this trauma as the descendants of great men who
							have dehumanized by white supremacy systems.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are facing a psychological problem because at this
							moment, Afrakans/Afrakan descendants are in an inferiority
							mental state that caused by these crimes of colonialism and it settled
							very well in their souls and paralyzed them.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are afraid of changing the historical narratives. We care
							much about the former colonizer’s feelings than our trauma and de-colonizing history.
						</p>
						<p>
							In our life time, we must commemorating them through raising
							them from the dead, walking miles in their shoes and facing the
							descendants of the colonizers tohonor and unfastening the white
							sheets that covered our black greatness for centuries. Let’s make
							Walk Of Death – Untold Truth Of The Afrakan Colonial Soldiers it
							rememberable and respected because every day of our lives is
							a page of our history.

							History will repeat itself when we are all ignorant and inferiority is
							etched very well in our minds. As the granddaughter of
							BMT4379/Cpl.N4379 – Benjamin Satiba Makgate/Ben Makgate –
							Mollo oa Marumo. I wrote this biography to honor him and his fellow
							Afrakan Colonial Soldiers (ACS), who were Prisoners of War (POW) in
							1939 – 1945 in Europe.
						</p>
						<p>
							He wrote a journal (diary) relating to their captivity on the 21 June
							1942 in Tobruk, Libya that needs to be narrated and shared with the
							entire world as a mechanism of de-colonizing history and deChristianizing God. Rewriting
							history is a must in our life time as the
							descendants of Afrakans who stomached centuries of crimes of
							colonialism and horrors of world wars.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ben Satiba Makgate was a tribalist, Corporal, Soldiers, Prisoner of war,
							priest, father, great grandfather, grandfather, brother, uncle and a
							friend, who fought during the Second World War [1939 – 1945]. He
							was amongst millions of Afrakans who liberated Europe from Fascism.
							Bear in mind, that Afrakans fought during both world war I and II but
							white leaders erased their heroism, bravery and great deeds of
							protecting the world from one of their fascists and racists with their
							lives.
						</p>
						<p>
							He noted most crucial atrocities and the brutalities they went through
							in his diary during their captivity in Europe as prisoners of war
							knowing very well that the white leaders, historians and cameraman will delete the
							importance of Afrakan soldiers in ending the wars. His
							prayers, hymns and versus from the bible made his life a living hell in
							the hands of the enemy as prisoners. His motivation and faith were
							stronger that the mountains and hope was the only mental shield for
							any situation they came across as Afrakan soldiers.
						</p>
						<p>
							He was born on the 01st of January 1906 in Boomplaas, Lydenburg,
							which is in the eastern part of South Afraka. He was the last son of
							Matatane Martha & Sefofele Samuel Makgate. His parents passed
							away when he was eleven (11) years old. His mother passed on in
							1917 and the father was promoted to glory the following year. He had
							two siblings, a brother Mmotlana Solomon and a sister Tlakale Sarah.
							They were orphans and lived with their uncle Mamatšhiri Enos
							Makgate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bloomplaas was and is still a beautiful fertile land near Lydenburg in
							Mpumalanga, South Afraka and it belongs to the indigenous South
							Afrakans and Benjamin Satiba Makgate’s family was living in that area.
							During the apartheid era, white people (Afrikaners) used to settle for
							fertile lands in South Afraka and forcefully moved Black people from
							most of their lands such as Boomplaas according to the 1913 Native
							Land act. Black people who were residing in Boomplaas before
							Afrikaners arrived in South Afraka in 1856 were landless. It was a land
							with lot of water and grazing areas for their livestock and mostly for
							farming/ploughing/cultivating food for their families and the rest of
							the society.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most white people who settled in those areas were fellow white
							soldiers who fought during the World War II and were compensated
							by the apartheid regime with new houses/homes and the fertile lands
							except my grandfather (Benjamin Satiba Makgate) and his fellow black
							soldiers. They were given soldier boots, bicycles and the lucky ones
							got a horse. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission is still on
							the process of commemoration for those who fought and passed on
							and for the few left who survived. The Commission is working to
							commemorate the forgotten ACS for almost eighty (80) years, which is
							an indication of unwillingness for justice, remembrance and
							reparations.
						</p>
						<p>
							He was conscripted between 1939 and 1940, which he said; we were
							playing football (soccer) on the dusty grounds in Bloomplaas when
							white men approached us and lying that they are looking for people to
							work in factories and mines. We were still young and looking for jobs.
							They were having lots of food such as preserved beefs and breads. We
							never knew that we will not see our families again until the end of
							World War II. Bear in mind that they were on a horrendous mission of
							targeting young black males during apartheid system to join the
							forces.
						</p>
						<p>
							After the 2nd world war he married Violet Magophethedi
							Masegankane Mampe Matladi Moetanalo. They were blessed with
							seven (7) children, six (6) girls (Mangiare, Nthapama, Nkitsing, Aspro,
							Moetana and Kidibone) and the only son named Mosotho.
						</p>
						<p>
							He once worked at Ok Bizaar in Germiston and Vleisboom bakery. He
							was a priest/ministering at Thwala Street, Witbank/Emalahleni for
							Lutheran Church of South Africa from 1966 until1983 and for
							Lutheran Reformed Church of Southern Africa in 1980 until he
							became a Bishop and retired in 1990. His wife passed on the 1st of July
							1995 at Nelspruit. He wished to join her before one year of her
							passing on and his wish was granted by badimo ba ba botse because
							he was admitted at Jane Furse hospital for a short illness. He shared
							with me (Matilda TheeGreat) his wish before he passes on by saying; I
							don’t want my wife to leave me for a year because I want to be with
							her in the grave. He passed away on the 01st May 1996 and he
							savored by his seven (7) children, twenty-eight (28) grandchildren,
							thirty-two (32) great grand grandchildren and three (3) great-great
							grandchildren.

						Memorial Soul Repatriation: October 28th 2023 Berlin
					</h3>
					<div class="mb-70 color-heading f-18 text-adaptive aos-animate" style="color:#dedede">
						<p>
							It’s been a long four (4) years since I began to commemorate our forefathers
							who fought during the World War I & II in Europe. This year marks 79 years
							of the ending of World War II, whereby more than 1000 000 indigenous
							South Africans (blacks) served in both white wars as part of Native Military
							Corps in South Afraka but their contribution was largely unrecognized.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has begun with a process of
								commemoration for ages especially those who fought and died, even the
								few who survived.</b> The process of the Commission to commemorate the
							forgotten Afrakan Colonial Soldiers (ACS) took almost eighty (80) years,
							which is an indication of unwillingness for justice, remembrance and
							reparations.
						</p>
						<p>
							I decided to take the matters into my own hands to commemorate our
							forefathers by hosting lengthy remembrance, which supported by my
							grandfather’s diary and him as he was a living witness.
						</p>
						<p>
							This year’s theme is <b>“Memorial Soul Repatriation”</b> as we are rectifying
							the errors of yesterday by de-colonizing and re-writing world history
							today on 28 October 2023 through <b>Walk Of Death – Untold Truth Of
								The Afrakan Colonial Soldiers</b> at the South African Embassy Berlin.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are unifying the souls of our own Afrakan forefathers, who fought
							during the World Wars and millions died whereas some survived to
							narrate the horrific treatment as inferior to white soldiers. I am
							repatriating the souls of Afrakan soldiers who died during the wars
							without proper burials to their peaceful resting place in Afraka with
							these white seven (7) flags, which represent purification and peace.

						Monumental Lengthy Memorials: October 2022 (24 - 28th) Berlin
					</h3>
					<div class="mb-70 color-heading f-18 text-adaptive aos-animate" style="color:#dedede">
						<p>
							Walk of Death is one of the horrors of the World Wars and crimes of colonialism that white
							historians have never written in world-historical books and televised for the past 79 years.
							Bear in mind that there’s no healing without my forefathers and no walk of death without my
							grandfather: BMT4379/Cpl.N4379.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our 3rd annual memorial was a success. It took place over five days at different five
							locations:
						</p>
						<p>
							- South African Embassy accepted and signed our memorandum of demands on Monday, 24th
							October and the other three embassies quietly ignored our call namely: British, French, and
							Italian, which is understandable because they are perpetrators that are protecting their
							errors of yesterday and the white supremacy systems as their legacy. The German
							Parliament/Bundestag covered their faces with their hands as a sign of guiltiness and shame
							to face the descendants of Afrakan Colonial Soldiers and Prisoners of Wars because the
							imposed walk of death was masterminded by their fascism leaders.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are pleased to find a base for the event to be celebrated at one place/spot every year in
							Berlin, Germany until the monument is been installed and let meet in Kumasi, the 2nd largest
							city of Ghana and the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom early next year.
